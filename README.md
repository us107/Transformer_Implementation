Transformer from Scratch with PyTorch
=====================================

This project demonstrates how to build the foundational Transformer model—originally introduced in the paper _"Attention is All You Need"_—entirely from scratch using PyTorch. It walks through core components such as self-attention, positional encoding, and the encoder-decoder architecture, all with a clear, modular structure.

Overview
--------

The tutorial provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing a Transformer model, without relying on pre-built libraries like Hugging Face. It's perfect for those interested in learning the internal mechanics of modern sequence-to-sequence models, especially in natural language processing.

Key Features
------------

*   **Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention:** Learn how attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
    
*   **Positional Encoding:** Understand how the model incorporates sequence order without recurrence or convolution.
    
*   **Encoder and Decoder Blocks:** See how layers are built using residual connections, layer normalization, and feed-forward networks.
    
*   **Masking and Padding:** Explore the importance of masking to prevent the model from attending to future tokens or padded positions.
    
*   **Training Loop:** Includes a basic training example on synthetic data for demonstration.
    
*   **Evaluation:** Basic validation logic is shown to measure the model’s learning progress.
    

What You Will Learn
-------------------

*   The inner workings of transformer models.
    
*   How to manually construct each module from the ground up.
    
*   How to stack layers to build a full encoder-decoder architecture.
    
*   How to train a transformer using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
    
*   How to evaluate model performance and prepare for downstream NLP tasks.
    

Requirements
------------

This project uses PyTorch and standard Python libraries. You will need a basic Python environment with PyTorch installed.

Notes
-----

*   The tutorial uses synthetic data to explain the model structure and training procedure. It is not meant to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but to help you understand how transformers work under the hood.
    
*   For real-world applications, you should integrate tokenization, batching, learning rate scheduling, and use appropriate datasets.
